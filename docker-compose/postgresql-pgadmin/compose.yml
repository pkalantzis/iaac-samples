# This Docker Compose file sets up local PostgreSQL and pgAdmin instances using Docker containers.
# The 'postgresql_srv' and 'pgadmin_srv' services use the latest official PostgreSQL and pgAdmin images.
# The PostgreSQL container's port 5432 is exposed to the host machine port 5432, so as databases can be accessed remotely.
# The pgAdmin container's port 80 is also exposed to the host machine port 15432, so as PostgreSQL databases can be managed remotely from respective web interface.
#
# To start the environment, run 'docker compose up -d' in this directory, and to stop it, run 'docker compose down'.
# You will be required to enter the database credentials (username:you@email.com password:admin) to connect.
#
# The following sample is intended for use in local development environments such as project setups, etc. 
# This sample must not be deployed in production environments.
