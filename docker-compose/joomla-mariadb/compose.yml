# This Docker Compose file sets up a local Joomla development environment using Docker containers.
# The 'joomla_srv' and 'mariadb_srv' services use the latest official Joomla and MariaDB Docker images.
# The MariaDB container's port 3306 is exposed to the host machine port 3306, so as databases can be accessed remotely.
# The Joomla container's port 80 is also exposed to the host machine port 8000, so as the Joomla webiste can be managed remotely from respective web interface.
# The Joomla files are also mapped to a local directory, and variables are used to configure the database settings.
#
# To start the environment, run 'docker compose up -d' in this directory, and to stop it, run 'docker compose down'.
# You will be asked to setup the the Wordpres site details during initialisation step of the setup.
#
# The following sample is intended for use in local development environments such as project setups, etc. 
# This sample must not be deployed in production environments.
